It consists of a rotary dial for step selection (12 steps), a slider for pitch selection, LED's for step and pitch indication and one potentiometer for speed/tempo selection. Under the hood there is an atmega 328 running the arduino bootloader, and a digital potentiometer for control voltage output to control analog synthesizers.</p>

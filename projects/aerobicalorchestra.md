In this project, together with [Juan Duarte](http://juanduarteregino.com) we created a performance which merges physical activities to musical expression. The setup consisted of a heart rate sensor and a self-actuated drum, a Kinect and digital sounds, physical exercise and dirty visuals.

Later, the aerobical orchestra expanded into brain wave sensors, more sophisticated live visuals and a tangible interface, which you can have a peak at [here](https://vimeo.com/43390253#t=2m59s).

Immediate Invisible is a wearable electronics fashion collection that I helped create with fashion designer Liisa Pesonen and composer Samuli Tanner. It was the topic of [Liisa's master's thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11776). The aim was to generate an evolving soundscape that responds to the involuntarily processes inside the wearer.

All the clothes in the collection are functional. Each of them belong to one of three categories: computer, speaker or physiological sensor. The collection is fully modular: any combination of three clothes of each category can form a functional outfit.

Technologies used:

*	Raspberry Pi
*	[Pure data](http://www.puredata.info/) for audio synthesis.
*	My [RT-Bio python library](https://www.github.com/vatte/rt-bio) for analysing physiological signals in real-time.
*	Custom sensors for EMG and skin conductance, [Pulse Sensor](http://www.pulse-sensor.com) for PPG and [Sports Tracker](http://www.sportstracker.com) bluetooth breast strap for EKG.

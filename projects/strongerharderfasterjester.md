We created Stronger Harder Faster Jester during the Music Hack Day Helsinki together with Tuomas Ahva, and also won the echo nest prize for the best hack in that event. The project is a set of pitch following juggling balls. By using three Blobo balls (a now discontinued gaming product made by a Finnish company) we were able to extract the timing of the throws, and use that information to trigger pitches. The pitches are analyzed with the Echo Nest API from a famous song by Daft Punk. The software was written in python and Pure data.

If you are interested in parsing Blobo data from the bluetooth serial port with Pure Data or Max MSP, contact me.

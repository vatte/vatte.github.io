#Brain and Music Team
[The Brain and Music Team](http://www.cbru.helsinki.fi/music) is a research group in the Cognitive Brain Research Unit at the University of Helsinki. The research conducted there is a multidisciplinary effort for exploring the neural basis of music cognition. The research ranges from the development of musical cognition and musical expertise, to the use of music in clinical research and therapy.

I have worked as a research assistant and a master's thesis worker in the Brain and Music team from 2010-2013, and am still involved in some of the projects. In this work I have developed tools for research, planned and implemented experiment setups, analyzed and measured EEG and physiological, produced and analyzed audio, as well as conducted original research in the form of my MSc thesis "Tuning the Body to Music".

#Sound and Physical Interaction
[Sound and Physical Interaction](http://sopi.media.taik.fi) is a research group in the Department of Media at Aalto University focusing on sound and its use in physical and tangible interfaces. The research is practice-based, with a focus on developing prototype interfaces and evaluating them using design research methodologies.

I have worked in the Sound and Physical Interaction research group since 2011. My biggest role has been in designing and implementing the hardware and software prototypes. I have also had the opportunity to present the work in conferences and artistic installations internationally.

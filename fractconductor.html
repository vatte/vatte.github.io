<html><head></head><body><p><em>FractConductor</em> was a project we created with Jussi Härkönen, Veli Laamanen and Markus Lepistö at SibHack <a href="http://sibhack.fi">SibHack</a> organized at Ateneum in Helsinki. The project is a virtual conducting experience combined with amazing fractal graphics. I was in charge of making the <em>Interactive Conductors Baton</em> using a Blobo ball. The player can control both the graphics and the music by waving the baton.</p>

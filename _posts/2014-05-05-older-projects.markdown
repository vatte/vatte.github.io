I figured people visiting this site would like to know about other projects that I have been making. I hope to one day have enough time to properly document them better, but I'll try to collect miscellaneous projects in this post.

### Brainwise
Brainwise is a wearable electronics project we made together with costume designer Metti Nordin. It's an EEG hat that displays the wearers brain activity on the surface, through light fibre and RGB LED's. It's actually already quite well documented [on the course blog](http://wearable.mlog.taik.fi/category/thinkingcap/). To see the thinking cap in action, look at [the course project demo video](http://vimeo.com/33650282), our part starts at 6:30. The work was also featured in the [Aalto University Magazine](http://issuu.com/aaltouniversity/docs/aum_03_web/10).

### Immediate Invisible
Immediate Invisible is another wearable electronics project that I helped create with fashion designer Liisa Pesonen. It was the topic of [Liisa's master's thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11776). This was a really extensive project, which deserves its own online presence, hopefully soon!

###More coming
I will keep adding other old projects when I manage to take pictures and document them, please come back!

<html><head></head><body><p>Immediate Invisible is a wearable electronics fashion collection that I created with fashion designer Liisa Pesonen and composer Samuli Tanner. It was the topic of <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11776">Liisa's master's thesis</a>. The aim is to generate an evolving soundscape that responds to the involuntarily processes inside the wearer.</p>
<p>All the clothes in the collection are functional. Each of them belong to one of three categories: computer, speaker or physiological sensor. The collection is fully modular: any combination of three clothes of each category can form a functional outfit.</p>

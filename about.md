I'm Valtteri Wikstr√∂m and this is my blog and portfolio. I consider myself an interaction designer with a focus on physical interfaces and prototyping.

I'm currently a MA in New Media student at [Media Lab Helsinki](http://medialab.aalto.fi), where I also work as a research assistant in the [Sound and Physical Interaction](http://sopi.media.taik.fi) research group. I also have a MSc degree from Aalto University's School of Electrical Engineering.

I've built this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme).

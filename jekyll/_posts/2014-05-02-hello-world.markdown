I'm Valtteri Wikstr√∂m, an interaction designer, hardware and software developer, researcher and occasional teacher and media artist. My main interests are currently physical and physiological interfaces for controlling sound and making music. I will add information about my projects and activities on this blog, trying to include code as well in github repositories.

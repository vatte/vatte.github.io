<p>The project is a set of pitch following juggling balls. By using three Blobo balls (a now discontinued gaming product made by a Finnish company) we were able to extract the timing of the throws, and use that information to trigger pitches. The pitches are analyzed with the Echo Nest API from a famous song by Daft Punk. The software was written in python and Pure data.</p>

###Physical Interaction Design
I've been responsible for teaching the [Physical Interaction Design](http://sopi.media.taik.fi/teaching/pid/physical-interaction-design-spring-2014/) (25425) course at Aalto University's [Media Lab Helsinki](http://medialab.aalto.fi/), where it is a part of the MA studies. On this course, students from different backgrounds are familiarised with technologies and methods of physical computing through hands-on exercises and also by working on their own project, which is presented at the end of the course.

Check out the student projects for my course runs:

* [Fall 2013](http://sopi.media.taik.fi/teaching/pid/fall-2013/student-projects/)
* Spring 2014 (Coming soon)
